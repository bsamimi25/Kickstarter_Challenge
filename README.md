Challenge #1 work 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to analyze different fundraising campaigns in realtion to their launch dates and fundraising goals. We were given the informaiton that Louise's play "Fever" cam close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. With this in mind we wil perform an anlaysis of the specific variables stated before (Launch Date and Goals)
## Analysis and Challenges
To start, I had to create four new columns to perform more of an indepth analysis. The first two columns were seprating the Category and Subcategory column into a Parent Category column and a Subcategory column. The next two columns were creatd by converting the Unix tmestamps that were provided on this sheet. This was one of my challenges on this sheet because the code to convert the timestamps were brand new to me. The following code was =(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1) J2 was the first data input of the unix timestamps at launched dates of their fundraisers. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
